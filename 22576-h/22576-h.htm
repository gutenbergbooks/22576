<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>"I come," said Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>
last week, "from a farming stock right
down from the Flood. The first thing
a farmer wants is to be secure." It
was of course during the Flood that
the insecurity of land tenure was most
noticeable.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>Lord <span class="sc">Carrick</span>, who a few months
ago was appearing in a sketch at the
Coliseum, seconded the Address in the
House of Lords. We are glad to note
the growth of ties between Parliament
and the Stage, and we are not without
hope that before long a further link
will be added in the person of <span class="sc">Sir
George Alexander</span>.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>A new form of flying
boat is being built in
America, in which it is
hoped that somebody
may fly from Newfoundland
to Ireland in fifteen
hours. In the event of
Home Rule, we trust, for
the sake of the intrepid
aviator, that a still fleeter
flying boat will be designed
for the return
journey.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>A resident of Waltham
Abbey has just received
a letter with a Waltham
Cross post-mark on the
back of the envelope
dated February, 31, 1914.
We understand that the
recipient proposes to
return the letter to the
Post Office marked
"Date unknown."</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>With reference to the Old Time
Supper which is to be a feature of the
Chelsea Arts Club Ball we are requested
to state that it must not be taken that
all the food offered for consumption on
that occasion will bear the stamp of
antiquity.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>An enterprising publisher has, it is
rumoured, persuaded no less a personage
than Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> to write some
books for him, and we are promised
at an early date, "Essays on Lamb
(shorn)," "The Fortunes of Montrose,"
and other works of creative fancy.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>"I was shaved yesterday by a highly
intelligent young Pole," says a writer
in <i>The Express</i>. The Barber's Pole is
of course a very old institution.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>"Old Masters&mdash;<span class="sc">Velasquez</span> and so
on&mdash;what are they?" said Mr. Justice
<span class="sc">Eve</span> last week during a case dealing
with pictures. "I should turn them
into cash if they were mine." Seeing
how often the old fellows painted
<span class="sc">Eve's</span> portrait, this <i>dictum</i> of his
Lordship strikes one as ungracious.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>Messrs. <span class="sc">Bryant and May</span> have issued
a brochure describing how little houses
may be made out of matches. A companion
volume, entitled "How to light
them," by a Suffragette, may be expected
shortly.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>It is sometimes asked, Why do so few
individuals when sentenced to death for
murder take advantage of their right
to appeal? The answer is, Because the
Court of Criminal Appeal has the power
of increasing a sentence.</p>

<h3>THE STRIKE OF SCHOOL-TEACHERS.</h3>

<p>Sir,&mdash;Is the nation properly alive to
the seriousness of the educational
<i>impasse</i> in Herefordshire? Personally
I view with alarm the state of things
of which that is a symptom.</p>

<p>What will it mean if this sort of
thing spreads, as I fear it may? We
shall have the children of our working-classes
growing up ill-educated and
with imperfect manners. Their spelling
will become phonetic. They will cease
to speak grammatically. They will
lose their pleasing accent. Their lack
of instruction in arithmetic may even
lead them into errors savouring of
criminality. Worse, they will fall
back in their appreciation of music, art
and poetry. They will
be reading trashy and
sensational literature
rather than the classical
works to which our elementary
education
directs their tastes.</p>

<p>To my mind, the condition
of things is grave
in the extreme, and for
the sake of the children
I beg the nation to wake
up and put an end to
conditions which make
these strikes possible.</p>

<p>Yours obediently,</p>

<p><span class="sc">Educational Reformer.</span></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The most promising
event of last week
was the delightful strike
of school-teachers in that
beautiful county of Hereford.
Happy children,
thus to be freed from the shackles of our
so-called education. They will now go
to the only school worth learning in&mdash;the
school of Mother Nature; and if only
the strike will continue long enough
we shall see in years to come poets
and painters and musicians making a
glad procession from their Herefordshire
homes to carry light and joy into
our dark places.</p>

<p>Yours ecstatically,</p>

<p><span class="sc">Vavasour Pringle.</span></p>

<h2>GUESS WHO IT IS.</h2>

<p>From a Competition in <i>People of Position</i>
(with which are incorporated <i>West
End Whispers and Mayfair Mysteries</i>).
Prizes will be awarded to the three
readers who are first, second, and third

in the Guess Who It Is series of articles.</p>

<p>First Prize, a copy of this year's

and Mayfair Mysteries</i>.)</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>She is a woman who matters very
much indeed. By birth and by marriage
she belongs to two extremely ancient
families, which were settled in Britain
when it was entirely covered with
forests and inhabited largely by wild
beasts. But it is not any advantage of
birth or of wealth that has made her the
great social figure she is. It is her
extraordinary charm and her arresting
personality. She is not strictly beautiful,
but her smile is peculiarly her own&mdash;a
rare distinction in these days when
there is so much that is artificial.</p>

<p>She has the reputation of being one
of the three best dressed women in
Europe, and never wears anything, not
even her boots, more than once. Her
wit is positively brilliant, and in this
connection it may be asserted once for
all that it was she who first gave vogue
to the greeting, "Doodledo," an abbreviated
form of "How d'you do," though
others have been given the credit for
that sparkling pleasantry. In the art
of "setting down" she is unapproachable,
combining gentle courtesy with
fine satire and mordant epigram, as on
the occasion when a certain pushing
and impossible outside person claimed
her acquaintance in public with a loud
"How are you?" With her own look
and smile she turned and gave him his
<i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>&mdash;"Not any the better for
seeing you!"&mdash;at which an exalted
foreign Personage, who was chatting
with her laughed so much that he fell
into an apoplexy.</p>

<p>She and her husband are sometimes
at their beautiful place in Middleshire,
and sometimes at their mansion in
Belvenor Square. When they are not
in England they are generally abroad.
She is devoted to horse-riding, motoring,
yachting, and ski-ing, but has not, like
some of her set, forgotten how to walk.
On the contrary, when in town she may
occasionally be seen taking this old-fashioned
form of exercise in the Park,
placing one foot alternately before the
other in her charmingly characteristic
manner.</p>

<p>She has once or twice, in a delightfully
mischievous spirit, amused herself
by flouting those very social ordinances
of which she is an acknowledged high
priestess. When wars, strikes, and
Governments are forgotten, it will still
be remembered how, some years ago
when she was a few months younger
than she is now, she appeared in her
box at the opera on a <span class="sc">Melba</span> (<i>and
therefore a tiara</i>) night wearing a necklace
of spar beads and a large ribbon
bow on her head. An electric shock
ran through the house; opera and
singers were unheeded; and the beautiful
Countess of &mdash;&mdash; tore the family
diamonds from her head and neck, and,
with a shriek of despair, flung them into
the orchestra.</p>

<p>The subject of our article could have
shone in any or all of the arts, had she
cared to give her time and talents to
them. Let it be said, too, that, though
surrounded from her infancy with "all
this world and all the glory of it," she
has a serious side to her character,
countenances the Church, and by no
means discourages religion.</p>

<p>It is widely known that she keeps a
diary. Ah! if only that diary, in its
dainty, morocco, gold-clasped volumes,
could be abstracted from the wonderful
mother-o'-pearl escritoire, carried out
of the exquisite Renaissance boudoir,
down the noble staircase and out of the
massive hall-door, and, after the spelling,
grammar and composition had
been slightly overhauled, if it could but
be published and given to the eager
world, what an intellectual feast it would
provide! And to the fair, gifted, high-born
diarist what a fortune it would
bring, and what a number of simply
<i>absorbing</i> libel cases!</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH'S PANTOMIME ANALYSIS.</h2>

<p>Now that the Pantomime season is
drawing to a close and the intelligent
student of this branch of Drama is
tempted to pass it in review, it may be
useful to him to have a list of possible
Pantomimes drawn up in a tabulated
form according to genus and species, that
their finer distinctions, so easily overlooked,
may be the better apprehended.
<i>Mr. Punch</i> has no hesitation in placing
his nice erudition at the disposal of
his readers.</p>

<p>Pantomimes may be divided into
those of a distinctly Oriental origin and
<i>milieu</i> and those which are either
associated with Occidental localities or
with none in particular. For convenience
we may divide them broadly
and loosely into Oriental and Non-Oriental
Pantomimes. Very well, then.</p>

one and manhandle it in this way"&mdash;He
put it on the table and began
punching and squeezing and puffing
and smoothing it till it had expanded
to its full extent. Then he flicked the
dust off it with his handkerchief. "I'll
put it back in its box under the sofa,"
he said. "I can't understand how it
ever got out."</p>

<p>He dropped into an
armchair and instantly
recovered his equanimity.</p>

<p>"And why should
they spare that one?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"That," said the old
man solemnly, "is my
bazaar cushion."</p>

<p>"I thought it looked
as if it had escaped
from a bazaar," said I.</p>

<p>"It came back only
last night," he went
on. "Are you a judge
of cushions? How do
you like it? Pretty
nice piece of work, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I cautiously.
"Looks to me
pretty well put together
and all that; but it's
rather&mdash;well, hideous,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said
Father William. "I
suppose it's the colour you object to. I
confess it's a bit of an eyesore. But
of course it has to be like that. It's a
case of protective colouring, you know."</p>

<p>I didn't quite follow his line of
thought and there was a short pause.
"You would hardly think to look at it,"
the old man went on at last, "that
that cushion has stood between me and
all the trials and persecutions incidental
to bazaars for nearly half a century.
Perhaps the plague is not quite so bad
as it was in the old days when I was
in my first City parish, but I must
say they were particularly active last
summer. They have taken to holding
them outside now, with Chinese lanterns,
so that there is no close season at all.
I had the wit at the very outset to see
that the thing must be grappled with.
They used to badger me in two separate
ways. I was always expected to send
some sort of contribution&mdash;and then I
had to go and buy things. That was
the worst of it. I used to dive about,
harassed and pursued, searching in
vain for the price of my freedom,
always confronted by smoking-caps
and impossible needlework. It was a
fearful ordeal."</p>

<p>"I know," said I, with sympathy.
"I know all about it."</p>

<p>"But I found a way out, thanks to
my cushion. I bought it at a Sale of
Work for Waifs and Strays nearly forty-seven
years ago, and I think you will
agree with me that it is a fairly good
cushion yet. Of course it has been
re-covered more than once. It was
getting altogether too well known in
Streatham at one time. It used to be
blue with horrid little silver spangles."</p>

<p>"And how does it work?"</p>

<p>"It is beautifully simple. I am told
that a bazaar is contemplated and
asked if I will assist. Very well, I
send my cushion. That is quite good
enough; no one would expect me to do
more. Then I go, on the appointed
day, buy the cushion, and walk out
with an enormous parcel for all the
world to see that I have done my duty.
Then it goes back in its box. The
only bazaars that I am unable to assist
are those which occur (as they sometimes
do) when my cushion happens
to be out."</p>

<p>"And is it never sold?"</p>

<p>"Well, <i>look</i> at it!" said Father
William. "Of course it had to be
of such a nature that there was no
danger of its going off too quick. I
used always to go early on the first
day to make sure. But since the
last time it was re-covered I have
had more confidence in its staying
powers. I find there is no particular
hurry."</p>

<p>"Do you put a price on it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I don't like to do that.
That might put me in an awkward
position if it came out. But I find it
fairly exciting on each occasion to
discover what I shall have to pay for it.
It is generally more expensive now
than it used to be in the old days.
I suppose it is the rise in the cost of
living. But I am seldom satisfied,
either way. If it is too cheap I
naturally feel rather slighted, seeing
that it was I who sent it; and if it is
too dear of course I am annoyed because
I have to buy it. And it fluctuates
extraordinarily. I have more than
once bought it in at
half-a-crown and come
home burning with indignation,
and, if you
will believe me, there
was a blackguard at
that big Sale of Work
for the Territorials in
the autumn who had the
effrontery to charge me
a guinea and a half. I
was furious with him."</p>

<p>"I wish you would
lend it to me, Father
William," said I, after
a pause. "We are getting
up a Jumble Sale
in Little Sudbury."</p>

<p>"No," said Father
William firmly, "no.
Little Sudbury is barred.
The last time it was
there on sale there was
a very painful scene.
I had arrived rather
late, I remember, and
I found my cushion
actually being sold by auction along
with a pair of worsted slippers and a
woolly door mat&mdash;in one lot. I thought
it showed very poor taste. Besides, it
is already booked to appear six times
in the next fortnight."</p>

<h2>WHEN BOSS EATS BOSS.</h2>

<p>According to the New York Correspondent
of <i>The Daily Chronicle</i>, the
publication of a letter from Mr. <span class="sc">Croker</span>,
formerly the great Tammany Chief,
attacking his successor, Mr. <span class="sc">Murphy</span>,
has greatly strengthened the campaign
for purifying the Administration.</p>

<p>The recent meeting of the Statistical
Society was rendered remarkable by a
letter from Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> who, in
regretting his inability to be present,
impressed upon the Society the need of
upholding a vigorous and fastidious
accuracy in the use of facts and figures.
"To gain a momentary triumph over
an antagonist in a public controversy
by a misquotation, even though only a
fraction is involved, is, in my opinion,
an act which permanently disqualifies
the offender from holding any place of
responsibility." These golden words,
so the President observed, ought to be
engraved in indelible letters in every
school in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The dignified and telling rebuke recently
addressed by Mr. <span class="sc">Bernard
Shaw</span> to Mr. G. K. <span class="sc">Chesterton</span>, for
undue indulgence in paradoxical gymnastics,
has given great satisfaction to
the members of the Society for the
Promotion of Simplified Thought. As
the President of the Society, Dr.
Pickering Phibbs, puts it, to have Mr.
<span class="sc">Shaw</span> on the side of the angels is
enough to make the Powers of Darkness
throw up the sponge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Keir Hardie's</span> remarkable
speech at Wolverhampton, when he
declared that it was the duty of Labour
to uphold the British Constitution, has
profoundly impressed Mr. <span class="sc">Larkin</span> and
Mr. <span class="sc">Lansbury</span>, who are of opinion that
the stability of the British Empire is
now assured for at least one hundred
years.</p>

<p>The publication of a letter from Mr.
<span class="sc">Roosevelt</span>, censuring President <span class="sc">Wilson</span>
for the prolixity and verbosity of
his Presidential messages, will, it is
believed, lend a powerful impetus to
the campaign on behalf of brevity in
public utterances.</p>

<h2>A GOLF JUDGMENT.</h2>

<p>(<i>To the Editor of "Punch."</i>)</p>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;As I am not at all satisfied
with the recent decision of The
Rules of Golf Committee on the position
created by a cow carrying off a ball in
her hoof, I appeal to you to arbitrate
in the following dispute between myself
and my friend A (for I am too courteous
to expose his actual name).</p>

<p>During some very wild weather we
made an arrangement, before starting
out, that, in the event of another storm
coming on, the game should be decided
by the score existing at the moment of
our consequent retirement.</p>

<p>A was in receipt of six bisques. I
holed out the first in five. A, who was
in well-deserved trouble all the way,
holed out in ten. I remarked, "One
up!" to which A made no response.
As we moved off to the second tee there
was a loud clap of thunder and the
heavens burst over our heads. A at once
shouted above the tumult, "I take my
six bisques and claim the hole and the
match." He then headed swiftly for
the pavilion.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that he was justified
in his claim. What do <i>you</i> think?</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,  <span class="sc">Fair Play.</span></p>

<p><i>Editor's Decision.</i>&mdash;The original
arrangement was bad in Golf Law.
The match is therefore off, and each
party must pay his own costs.</p>

<h2>TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.</h2>

<p>"Do you believe in magic?" Jack
asked.</p>

<p>I hedged.</p>

<p>"Well, whether you do or not," he
said, "I've got a rather rum story for
you."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," I replied.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "It was on
last Tuesday morning that I looked in
at the watchmaker's to see if my watch
was mended yet.</p>

<p>"It was hanging up in the glass case
above the bench where he worked, with
my name on a little tab attached to the
ring.</p>

<p>"'No,' the man said, 'it's not done&mdash;in
fact, I'm still observing it.'</p>

<p>"'But it seems to be recording the
time all right,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he replied&mdash;'seems, but it
isn't. That's mere chance. Do you
know, it's so fast that it's gained
exactly twenty-four hours since you
brought it in. That's not to-day's
time it's registering, but to-morrow's.
Leave it here another week, and I'll
have got to the bottom of the mystery.'</p>

<p>"At first I was disposed to do so;
and then I had an idea.</p>

<p>"'No,' I said, 'I'll take it.'</p>

<p>"'But it's useless to you,' he replied.</p>

<p>"'I'll take it," I said. 'Just for fun.'</p>

<p>"He gave it me reluctantly and returned
to his labours.</p>

<p>"I walked away from the shop very
thoughtfully. Here was a curious state
of things. I and the rest of the world
were living on Monday, February 9th,
while my watch was busily recording,
a little too hurriedly, the progress of
time on Tuesday, February 10th. To
see into the future has ever been man's
dearest wish, and here was I in possession
of a little piece of machinery which
actually was of the future and yet could
tell none of its secrets.</p>

<p>"But couldn't it? Couldn't I wrest
one at least from it?&mdash;that was what
worried me.</p>

<p>"As I pondered, a newspaper boy
passed me bearing the placard 'Selections
for Lingfield,' and in a flash I
bought one. My watch knew who had
won! How could I extract that information
from it?"</p>

<p>Jack paused.</p>

<p>"Good heavens," I interpolated,
"what an extraordinary situation!"</p>

<p>"You may well say so," he said.
"You see, if only I could share its
knowledge, I should be rich for life;
for it was now only a quarter to eleven,
and the first race was not till one-fifty,
and there was plenty of time to bet.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I continued on my way deep in
thought," Jack went on, "when whom
should I meet but Lisburne? Lisburne
is the most ingenious man I know.</p>

<p>"'Come and advise me,' I said, and
led him to a quiet corner.</p>

<p>"'It's jolly interesting,' he remarked,
when I had finished, 'but of course it's
black arts, you know, and we've lost
the key nowadays. Still we must try.'</p>

<p>"We discussed the thing every way,
in vain.</p>

<p>"Then suddenly he said, 'Look here,
this watch represents to-morrow. That
means it is through the watch that we
must work. Here, let's get to-day's
<i>Mail</i> and read it through the watch-glass
and see if there's any difference?'</p>

<p>"We got it and did so.</p>

<p>"Lisburne removed the glass, found
the racing news and read them through
it. 'Good heavens!' he said, and
turned white. 'Here, read this with
your naked eye,' he said, pushing the
paper before me.</p>

<p>"I read 'Saturday's racing results:
1.30, Midas 1, Blair Hampton 2,
Chessington 3,' and so on. 'Prices,
Midas 6-4,' etc.</p>

<p>"'Those are Saturday's results,' he
said, shaking with excitement. 'But
now read them through the watch-glass.'</p>

<p>"I did so, and they immediately
changed to Monday's results. I was
reading to-morrow's paper!</p>

<p>"'Look at the prices,' he cried.</p>

<p>"'The prices! I hastily ran through
them. They were splendid. "Captain
Farrell 10-1, Woodpark 10-1, Flitting
Light 4-1." And these horses, remember,'
he said, 'are going to run this
afternoon!'</p>

<p>"'What's the next thing to be
done?' I gasped.</p>

<p>"'The bookies,' he replied.</p>

<p>"'I suppose they're fair game,' I
said.</p>

<p>"'Of course,' he replied. 'The very
fairest. But that's nothing to do with
you, anyhow. You're in possession
of magic and must employ it. They
are the natural medium. How much
can you muster?'</p>

<p>"'I'd risk anything I could scrape
up,' I said. 'Say &pound;750. And you?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, I'm broke,' he replied. 'How
many bookies do you know?'</p>

<p>"'Three,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Well,' he replied, 'I know three
more, and we can find men who know
others, and who will bet for us. Because
we must plant this out warily, you
know, or they'll be suspicious.'</p>

<p>"'Will you take it in hand,' I asked,
'leaving me &pound;150 for my own commissioners?'</p>

<p>"'Of course,' he said, 'if you'll give
me ten per cent.;' and having copied
out all the longer-priced winners through
the watch-glass he hurried off, promising
to meet me at lunch.</p>

<p>"How to get through the intervening
time was now the question. First I
went to the telegraph office, and then
to the barber's to have my hair cut.
Forcibly to be kept in a chair was
what I needed. The hair-cut took
only half-an-hour; so I was shaved;
then I was shampooed; then I was
massaged; then I was manicured.
I should have been pedicured, but the
clock mercifully said lunch-time.</p>

<p>"Lisburne was there in a state of
fever. He had distributed the &pound;600
among fourteen different commission
agents.</p>

<p>"'Now we can have lunch,' he said,
'with easy minds.'</p>

<p>"Easy!</p>

<p>"'But suppose the whole thing is
a fizzle,' I said. 'We've been far too
impetuous. Impulse was always my
ruin.'</p>

<p>"'Oh no,' he said.</p>

<p>"'But if it's a fizzle,' I said, 'what
about my &pound;750?'</p>

<p>"'It won't be,' he replied. 'It's
magic. Let's order something to eat.'</p>

<p>"He ate; that is the advantage of
being on ten per cent. commission.
I couldn't."</p>

<p>Jack paused.</p>

<p>"Go on," I said. "Did the horses
win?"</p>

<p>"Every one," he replied.</p>

<p>"At those prices?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you're frightfully rich?"</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>"Why ever not? Surely the bookies
haven't refused to pay?"</p>

<p>"Oh no."</p>

<p>"Then why aren't you rich?"</p>

<p>"Because I did the usual silly thing&mdash;I
woke up."</p>

<h2>LETTERS AND LIFE.</h2>

<p>Preparations are already on foot
for the great banquet to be given in
honour of the famous Russian novelist,
Dr. Ladislas Plovskin, who is to visit
England in July. A representative
committee has been formed, which
includes, amongst others, Sir <span class="sc">Gilbert
Parker</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Garvice</span>, Mr.
<span class="sc">Silas Hocking</span>, Mr. C. K. <span class="sc">Shorter</span>,
Lord <span class="sc">Dunsany</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">James Douglas</span>
and Mr. <span class="sc">Edmund Gosse</span>, who will take
the chair at the banquet. There is a
peculiar appropriateness in this, for it
was Mr. <span class="sc">Gosse</span> who, some ten years
ago, first called attention to Plovskin
in one of his masterly studies. Since
then, Plovskin has gained the Nobel
Prize and become the object of a special
cult which has centres from Tomsk to
Seattle, and from Popocatapetl to
Oshkosh.</p>

<p>The address which will be presented
to the great Muscovite fictionist has
been written by Mr. <span class="sc">James Douglas</span>,
and is a masterpiece of sensitive and
discriminating eulogy. Thus in one
passage Mr. <span class="sc">Douglas</span> says, "while
preserving your own individuality with
miraculous independence, you have
summed up in your work all the
inchoate influences to be found in
<span class="sc">Homer, Dante, Shakspeare, Voltaire</span>
and <span class="sc">Verlaine</span>, and carried them to a
pitch of divine effulgence only to be
equalled in the godlike work of our
marvellous <span class="sc">Masefield</span>."</p>

<p>Dr. Plovskin is no stranger to England,
for he was an intimate friend of
the late <span class="sc">Edward Lear</span>, who alludes to
him under the name of Ploffskin in one
of his touching lyrics, and, as we have
seen, he owes almost everything to the
generous appreciation of Mr. <span class="sc">Gosse</span>, to
whom he has dedicated his last novel,
which bears the fascinating title of <i>The
Bad Egg</i>. Portions of this, it is to be
hoped, will be recited at the banquet
by the author's brother-in-law, Mr.
Ossip Bobolinsky, Managing Director
of the Anglo-Manchurian Steam Tar
Company.</p>

<p>In smart intellectual circles Tagore
Teas are now all the rage. At these
elegant and up-to-date entertainments
China tea is absolutely proscribed, the
refreshments, solid and liquid, being
exclusively of Indian origin. After tea
the guests cantillate passages from the
prose and poetry of the Great Indian
Master to the accompaniment of gongs
(the Sanskrit <i>tum-tum</i>) and one-stringed
Afghan jamboons, for the space of two
or three hours, when their engagements
permit. Sometimes the reading is
varied by mystical dances of a slow and
solemn character, but all laughter,
levity and exuberance are sedulously
discountenanced, the aim of all present
being to attain an attitude of serene
and complacent ecstasy which enables
them to invest utterances of the most
perfect ineptitude with a portentous
and pontifical significance.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p>(<span class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span>)</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday, February</i>
10.&mdash;Odd to find proceedings in
House to-day reminiscent of incident in
a famous trial. Occasion recognised as
supremely momentous. Marks, within
defined limit of time, crisis of bitter
controversy. Before Session closes fate
of Ireland and of the
Ministry will be settled.
<span class="sc">Premier's</span> speech awaited
with gravest anxiety.
Lobby thronged with
animated groups. Before
four o'clock&mdash;when
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> returned to
Chair elate with consciousness
of singular
foresight in having "for
greater accuracy" possessed
himself of copy of
<span class="sc">King's</span> Speech, presently
read to expectant Members,
most of whom heard
it delivered from the
Throne two hours earlier&mdash;stream
of humanity
flooded House, filling
every seat and crowding
Bar.</p>

<p>It was at preliminary
gathering that case of
<i>Bardell</i> v. <i>Pickwick</i> was
recalled. House awaiting arrival of
Black Rod with summons to repair to
gilded Chamber. Message delivered,
<span class="sc">Speaker</span>, escorted by <span class="sc">Serjeant-at-Arms</span>
carrying Mace, marches off. From
Treasury Bench and from Front Bench
opposite, Leader of House and Leader
of Opposition simultaneously rise and
fall in. Other Ministers and ex-Ministers
with mob of Members complete
procession.</p>

<p>When <span class="sc">Premier</span> and <span class="sc">Bonner Law</span>
met they heartily shook hands. <span class="sc">Captain
Craig</span> and <span class="sc">Moore</span> (of Armagh) looked
at each other in pained surprise.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;">
  <a href="images/133a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/133a.png" alt=""/></a>
  <p><i>Mr. Pickwick</i> (Captain <span class="sc">Craig</span>) regards with abhorrence the exchange of
salutations between <i>Serjeant Buzfuz</i> (Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>) and his own counsel, <i>Serjeant
Snubbin</i> (Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span>).</p>
</div>

<p>Here was the touch of nature that
makes the whole world kin. When
seated in court awaiting opening of
trial, <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> observed a learned
serjeant-at-law make friendly salutation
to his own counsel.</p>

<p>"Who's that red-faced man who said
it was a fine morning, and nodded to our
counsel?" he whispered to his solicitor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz," was the
reply. "He's opposed to us; he leads
on the other side."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pickwick</i>, it is recorded, regarded
with great abhorrence the cold-blooded
villainy of a man who, as
counsel for the opposite party, presumed
to tell <i>Mr. Serjeant Snubbin</i>,
who was counsel for him, that it was a
fine morning.</p>

<p>Thus <span class="sc">Moore</span> (of Armagh) and the
<span class="sc">Courageous Craig</span>. Here were the
contending forces set in battle array,
and the first thing they behold is their
Captain shaking hands with the commander
of the enemy! An ominous
beginning, they agreed, well calculated
to depress the spirits of men who mean
business.</p>

<p>It proved emblematical of what
followed. Expected that stupendous
occasion would be marked by dramatic
scenes, possibly by outbreak of disorder.
Nothing of that kind happened.
Scene was indeed impressive by reason
of Chamber being crowded from floor
to topmost bench of Strangers'
Gallery. Also, whilst <span class="sc">Premier</span> in unusually
low-spoken, comparatively halting
voice, delivered critical passages
of his speech, there was movement
marking intense interest. Multitude
on floor of House bent forward to
catch the murmured syllables. Members
crowding the side galleries stood up in
same anxious quest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">
  <a href="images/133b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/133b.png" alt=""/></a>
  <p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">John Burns</span></i> (<i>holding list of the four
new appointments to Government Departments,
including his own to the Board of Trade</i>).
"Excellent choices!&mdash;with perhaps the exception
of <span class="sc">Samuel, Hobhouse</span> and <span class="sc">Masterman</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>Otherwise the accustomed signs and
tokens of Parliamentary crisis were
conspicuously lacking. <span class="sc">Walter Long</span>,
whose return to fighting-line
after bout of illness
was warmly welcomed on
both sides, pitched the
opening note a little low.
Not fierce enough to
gratify Ulster, he correspondingly
failed to irritate
the Home Rulers.</p>

<p>As for <span class="sc">Premier</span>, his
part, adroitly played, was
to appear to be saying a
good deal without committing
himself to definite
pledges. Above all, not
to inflame controversy.
He brought with him unusually
copious notes,
but did not, as is his
wont on such occasions,
read from them the text
of especially weighty
passages. Spoke slowly,
occasionally in a murmur,
uttering his sentences
as if deliberately weighing each
word. Following <span class="sc">Walter Long</span>, he
was received with prolonged cheers,
testifying to personal popularity.
When he sat down cheering was more
polite than effusive.</p>

<p>Irish Nationalists barely contributed
even to this circumspect note of approval.
Throughout nearly an hour's
speech they sat in ominous silence,
listening to passages in which they
seemed to recognise disposition on part
of <span class="sc">Premier</span> towards mood of <i>Benedick</i>,
who, when he said he would die a
bachelor, never thought he would live
to be married.</p>

<p>Had not <span class="sc">Premier</span> within the last
twelve months frequently declared he
would never consent to exclusion of
Ulster from Home Rule Bill? And
wasn't he now showing signs of disposition
to surrender?</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Parliament reassembles.
<span class="sc">Walter Long</span>, on behalf of Opposition,
moves amendment to Address,
calling upon Government to appeal to
country before proceeding further with
Home Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Interest of sitting centred
in speeches of <span class="sc">Carson</span> and <span class="sc">John
Redmond</span>. Former met with rousing
reception from Opposition. Some
Ministerialists would have liked to join
in the demonstration, not because they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span>
share <span class="sc">Carson's</span> views or admire his
policy, but because they instinctively
feel admiration for a man of commanding
position who has sacrificed
personal and professional interests to
what he regards as the well-being of his
country. Esteem increased by merit
of his speech. Only once did he lapse
into tone and manner of personal
attack familiar to House when Ulster
Members and Nationalists, hating each
other for love of their country, join in
debate. Turning round to top bench
below Gangway, where <span class="sc">John Redmond</span>
sat attentive, he said: "If
you want Ulster, come and
take her, or come and win
her. But you have never
wanted her affections; you
have wanted her taxes."</p>

<p>This stung to the quick.
<span class="sc">Redmond</span>, leaping to his feet
when <span class="sc">Carson</span> resumed his
seat, hotly denounced accusation
as unworthy of his
countryman.</p>

<p>House already began to
show signs of satiety. Long
intervals when benches were
empty. <span class="sc">Cousin Hugh</span>, speaking
at favourable hour of six
o'clock, failed to attract an
audience to whom he might
present his cheering forecast
of an interval of six weeks
spent in listening to speeches
of Members below the Gangway,
"poked up by the <span class="sc">Chancellor
of the Exchequer</span>
to attack the <span class="sc">First Lord of
the Admiralty</span>." Benches
crowded whilst <span class="sc">Carson</span> and
<span class="sc">Redmond</span> spoke. Filled up
again when <span class="sc">Chancellor of
Exchequer</span> in brief speech
wound up debate on behalf
of Government, and <span class="sc">Bonner
Law</span>, as usual unencumbered
by notes, replied.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Demand
for immediate dissolution negatived by
333 votes against 255. Opposition
elate at reduced majority.</p>

<p>"I fancy," said <span class="sc">Premier</span>, smiling
serenely upon the <span class="sc">Winsome Winston</span>,
"they would gladly suffer from our complaint."</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Thursday.</i>&mdash;Noble
Lords, having disposed of Address,
already find themselves in condition of
frozen-out gardeners who have no work
to do. Session but a few days old has
already afforded fresh sign of disposition
to belittle hereditary Chamber.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">
  <a href="images/134.png"><img width="100%" src="images/134.png" alt=""/></a>
  <p>"Noble Lords already find themselves in condition of frozen-out
gardeners who have no work to do."</p>
  <p>(Lord <span class="sc">Curzon</span> and Lord <span class="sc">Lansdowne</span>.)</p>
</div>


<p>It happened thus. On opening night
Lord <span class="sc">Londonderry</span>, making his way
along Peers' Gallery in Commons, came
upon extraordinary sight. A stranger
on front seat overlooking sacred quarter
allotted to Peers, finding himself incommoded
by hat and overcoat, neatly
folded up the latter, dropped it on the
Peers' bench beneath and carefully
placed his hat upon it. Hadn't <span class="sc">Lloyd
George</span> demonstrated that the land
belonged to the people? Here was
undeveloped space. As a free man
he claimed it for his own uses.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Londonderry</span>, halting, angrily regarded
the incumbrance. Turned about
with evident intention of calling attendant's
notice to unparalleled liberty.
At that moment his eye fell on the
countenance of the stranger. Could it
be? Yes; it was the school proprietor
whose patriotic offer of aid to Ulster
in approaching civil war he had a few
days earlier reported to an admiring
nation. Letter offered to provide for
two sons of any Ulster volunteer who
fell in battle with the myrmidons of an
iniquitous Ministry. As sometimes
happens, pearl of the letter was hidden
in the postscript. Writer explained that
he could not very well go to the war
himself but would send his partner.</p>

<p>Recognition placed new aspect on
little affair. <span class="sc">Londonderry</span> perceived
it was simple ignorance of customs of
the place that led to apparent indiscretion.
So with genial nod passed on
to seat over the clock.</p>

<p>Few minutes later outraged attendant,
catching sight of the bundle, peremptorily
ordered its removal.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;By 243 votes against
55 Lords carried <span class="sc">Middleton's</span> amendment
to Address demanding immediate
dissolution. <span class="sc">Willoughby de Broke</span>
communicated to the <span class="sc">Member for Sark</span>
his conviction that this hide-bound
Government will take no notice of the
mandate.</p>

<p>"Reminds me," said the Bold Baron,
brushing away a manly tear, "of a
hymn I learned in the nursery:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>'Tis not enough to say</p>
<p class="i2">You're sorry and repent</p>
<p>If you go on in the same way</p>
<p class="i2">As you did always went.'"</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p>"<span class="sc">The Melting Pot</span>."</p>

<p>It is impossible not to respect the
earnestness of Mr. <span class="sc">Zangwill</span> when he
treats of the persecution of his co-religionists
in Russia, or their social
exclusion in America. But when he
appeals to an English audience he is
addressing the converted. It is a good
many years since the pogram was a
popular form of amusement in this
country, and at present the Jew is the
flattered idol of English Society. It
may seem surprising that his play
should have had so great a success in
the States, where they are not supposed
to have a passion for hearing home
truths. But then its main theme is
the glorification of America as the
Melting Pot or crucible into which are
flung the wrongs and hatreds and
slaveries of the old world, to re-appear
in the shape of justice and love and
freedom. This is the theme upon
which <i>David Quixano</i>, a Kishineff
Jew who has lost all his family in a
massacre, goes from time to time into
an orgy of lyrical raptures. And indeed
the swiftness with which the naturalised
immigrant, of just any nationality,
assimilates himself to local conditions,
instantly changing his heart with his
change of sky, and learning to wave
his stars and stripes with the best of
the native-born, must seem miraculous
to the ordinary patriot. And here we
touch the weak spot in Mr. <span class="sc">Zangwill's</span>
p&aelig;an of the Melting Pot. For those
who migrate to America for the sake
of its democratic freedom are the few;
and those who go there for the sake
of its dollars are the many; and into
the Melting Pot&mdash;or, to use an image
more apposite to indigenous tastes, its
Sausage Machine&mdash;are thrown not only
the wrongs and hatreds of unhappy
races but also the dear traditions of
birth and blood and family ties and
pride of country, to emerge in a uniform
pattern without a past.</p>

<p>For his plot, Mr. <span class="sc">Zangwill</span> relies
upon a very stagy coincidence. <i>Quixano</i>
falls in love with a young Russian girl
who conducts a Settlement Home in
New York, and conquers her prejudice
against his race, only to find that she is
the daughter of the very officer who
permitted the massacre at Kishineff in
which <i>Quixano's</i> family had perished,
and himself been wounded. In turn
he naturally has his own prejudices to
conquer, and does so. But not till he
has scared us with the fear that he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span>
going to be false to his theory of purification
by process of the Melting Pot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Walker Whiteside</span>, who plays
the part, was excellent in his quiet moods,
and when he was obliged to rant was no
worse than other ranters. The superb
solidity of Mr. <span class="sc">Sass</span> as the Russian
officer served as an admirable foil to the
mercurial methods of <i>Quixano</i>. Miss
<span class="sc">Phyllis Relph</span> as the heroine mitigated
the effect of her obvious sincerity
by a bad trick of showing her nice
teeth. Mr. <span class="sc">Perceval Clark</span>, as a
young American millionaire, was pleasantly
British. Humorous relief of a
cosmopolitan order was provided by
the Irish brogue of Miss <span class="sc">O'Connor</span>;
the broken English of Miss <span class="sc">Gillian
Scaife</span>; the Anglo-German of Mr. <span class="sc">Clifton
Alderson</span> who played very well
as <i>Herr Pappelmeister</i> (Kapellmeister
to a New York orchestra); and what I
took to be the Yiddish of Miss <span class="sc">Inez
Bensusan</span> as the aunt of the hero, a
pathetic figure of an old lady with firm
views about the keeping of the Jewish
Sabbath, and a pedantic habit of
celebrating with a false nose and other
marks of hilarity the anniversary of
the escape of the Chosen People from
a Persian pogram twenty-five centuries
ago.</p>

<p>It might seem from this long catalogue
of humorists that frivolity was
the prevailing note of the play. But I
can give assurances that this was not so.
The prevailing note was a high seriousness,
culminating in the last Act, when
tedium supervened. I attribute my
final depression in part to the scene&mdash;a
bird's-eye view of New York from the
roof-garden of the Settlement House.
It was impossible to share <i>Quixano's</i>
spasm of exaltation in the matter of the
Melting Pot as he gazed on this very
indifferent example of scenic art.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">"A Midsummer Night's Dream."</span></p>

<p>I am not sure that Mr. <span class="sc">Granville
Barker's</span> faithful followers are being
quite kindly entreated by him. He
happens to have a keen sense of humour
and for some little while he has been
trying, with a very grave face, to see
how much they will swallow. This
time, everybody else except the initiated
can see the bulge in his cheek where
his tongue comes.</p>

<p>The alleged faults of the old school,
which the new was to correct, were
(1) an over-elaboration of detail in the
setting; (2) a realism which challenged
reality. ("Challenge," I understand, is
the catch-word they use.) Both these
qualities were supposed to distract
attention from the drama itself. The
answer, almost too obvious to be worth
stating, is that the grotesque and the
eccentric are vastly more distracting
than the elaborate; and that, if you
only sound the loud symbol loud
enough the audience has no ear left at
all for the actual words. As for the
"challenging" of reality the new school
would argue that, as the stage is a thing
of convention to start with&mdash;artificial
light, no natural atmosphere or perspective,
no fourth wall, and so on&mdash;all
the rest should be convention too. The
answer, again almost too obvious, is
that, since the audience has to bear
the strain of unavoidable convention,
you should not wantonly add to their
worry. And, anyhow, the human
figures on your stage (I leave out
fairies and superhumans for the moment)
are bound to challenge reality
by the fact that they are alive. If Mr.
<span class="sc">Barker</span> wants to be consistent (and he
would probably repudiate so Philistine
a suggestion) his figures should be
marionettes worked by strings; and
for words&mdash;if you <i>must</i> have words&mdash;he
might himself read the text from a
corner of the top landing of his proscenium.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">
  <a href="images/136.png"><img width="100%" src="images/136.png" alt=""/></a>
  <p><i>Hermia</i> (Miss <span class="sc">Laura Cowie</span>). "I upon this
bank will rest my head."</p>
</div>

<p>And the strange thing is that no one
in the world has a nicer sense of the
beauty of <span class="sc">Shakspeare's</span> verse than
Mr. <span class="sc">Barker</span>. Indeed he protests in his
preface: "They (the fairies) must be not
too startling.... <i>They mustn't warp
your imagination&mdash;stepping too boldly
between <span class="sc">Shakspeare's</span> spirit and
yours.</i>" (The italics are my own comment.)
He is of course free, within
limits, to choose his own convention
about fairies, because we have never
seen them, though some of us say we
have. Mr. <span class="sc">Chesterton</span> naturally says
they can be of any size; Mr. <span class="sc">Barker</span>
says they can be of any age from little
<i>Peaseblossom</i> and his young friends to
hoary antiques with moustaches like
ram's horns and beards trickling down
to their knees. And as many as like it,
and are not afraid of being poisoned,
may have gilt faces that make them
look like Hindoo idols with the
miraculous gift of perspiration. But
he should please remember that the
play is not his own. It is, in point of
fact, <span class="sc">Shakspeare's</span>, and I am certain
he was not properly consulted about the
Orientalisation of the fairies out of his
Warwickshire woodlands. You will be
told that he <i>has</i> been properly consulted;
that he himself makes <i>Titania</i>
say that <i>Oberon</i> has "come from the
furthest steppe of India," and that she
too had breathed "the spiced Indian
air." But on the same authority Mr.
<span class="sc">Barker</span> might just as well have fixed
on Asia Minor or Greece as their provenance.
She charges <i>Oberon</i> with
knowing <i>Hippolyta</i> too well, and he
accuses her of making <i>Theseus</i> break
faith with a number of ladies. Clearly
they were a travelling company and
would never have confined themselves
to the costumes of any particular clime.</p>

<p>Anyhow, when at His Majesty's you
saw <i>Oberon</i> in sylvan dress moving
lightly through a wood that looked like
a wood (and so left your mind free to
listen to him), you could believe in all
the lovely things he had to say; but
when you saw Mr. <span class="sc">Barker's</span> <i>Oberon</i>
standing stark, like a painted graven
image, with yellow cheeks and red eyebrows,
up against a symbolic painted
cloth, and telling you that he knows a
bank where the wild thyme blows, you
know quite well that he knows nothing
of the kind; and you don't believe a
word of it.</p>

<p>But, to leave <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span> decently
out of the question, I liked the gold
dresses of the fairies enormously, so
long as <i>Puck</i>&mdash;a sort of adult Struwel-Puck
that got badly on my nerves&mdash;was
not there, destroying every colour
scheme with his shrieking scarlet suit,
which went with nothing except a few
vermilion eyebrows. I liked too the
grace of their simple chain-dances on
the green mound (English dances, you
will note, and English tunes&mdash;not Indian).
But in the last scene, where they
interlace among the staring columns,
their movements lacked space. Indeed
that was the trouble all through; that,
and the pitiless light that poured point-blank
upon the stage from the 12.6
muzzles protruding from the bulwarks
of the dress-circle. There was no distance,
no suggestion of the spirit-world,
no sense of mystery (except in regard
to Mr. <span class="sc">Barker's</span> intentions).</p>

<p>The best scene was the haunt of
<i>Titania</i>, with its background of Liberty
curtains very cleverly disposed. As
drapery they were excellent, but as
symbols of a forest I found them a
little arbitrary. I do not mind a forest
being indicated, if you are short of
foliage, by a couple of trees (in tubs, if
you like) or even a single tree; but
somehow&mdash;and the fault is probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span>
mine&mdash;the spectacle of hanging drapery
does not immediately suggest to me
the idea of birds' nests. I am afraid I
should be just as stupid if Mr. <span class="sc">Barker</span>
gave me the same convention the other
way round, and showed an interior
with foliage to indicate window-curtains.</p>

<p>The play itself, with its rather foolish
figures from the Court and the easy
buffoonery of its peasants, does not offer
great chances of acting; and Miss
<span class="sc">Laura Cowie</span> was the only one in the
cast who added to her reputation. Her
<i>Hermia</i> was a delightful performance
full of charm and piquancy and real
intelligence. Miss <span class="sc">Lillah McCarthy</span>
sacrificed something of her personality
to the exigences of a flaxen chevelure.
Mr. <span class="sc">Holloway's</span> <i>Theseus</i> was wanting
in kingliness, and his hunting scene
was perhaps the worst thing in the play.
He was not greatly helped by his
<i>Hippolyta</i>, for Miss <span class="sc">Evelyn Hope</span>
never began to look like a leader of
Amazons. Miss <span class="sc">Christine Silver's</span>
<i>Titania</i> had a certain domestic sweetness,
but even a queen of fairies might
be a little more queenly. Mr. <span class="sc">Dennis
Neilson-Terry</span> as <i>Oberon</i> was a
curiously effeminate figure for those
who recalled the manly bearing of his
mother in the same part. Of the two
bemused Athenian lovers, Mr. <span class="sc">Swinley</span>,
as <i>Lysander</i>, bore himself as bravely as
could be expected.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Nigel Playfair</span> had, of course, no
difficulty with the part of <i>Bottom</i>, and
Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur Whitby's</span> <i>Quince</i> and
Mr. <span class="sc">Quartermaine's</span> <i>Flute</i> were both
excellent. It is to the credit of the whole
troupe of rustic players that nobody
tried to force the fun.</p>

<p>Apart from a slight tendency to
hurry, a trick that, except in swift
dialogue or passionate speech, gives the
effect of something learnt by heart and
not spontaneous, the delivery of the
lines&mdash;and some of <span class="sc">Shakspeare's</span> most
exquisite are here&mdash;was done soundly.</p>

<p>Finally, no one who wants to keep
level with the table-talk of the day
should miss this interesting and intriguing
production, especially if he hasn't
been to <i>Parsifal</i>.</p>

<h2>INTELLECTUAL DAMAGE TO ANIMALS.</h2>

<p>We gather from <i>The Daily Sketch</i>
that a reverend gentleman at Herne
Bay has just founded the S. P. M. C. A.,
or "Society for the Prevention of
Mental Cruelty to Animals," and holds,
as part of his propaganda, that the Zoo
should be disbanded and abolished, and,
in fact, that no wild animals or birds
should be kept anywhere in captivity
at all.</p>

<p>The S. P. M. C. A. fills a long-felt want.
Everyone with any sense of politeness
or tact must recognise that it is grossly
improper to wound the feelings of the
lower orders of creation by the opprobrious
use of such epithets as ass, donkey,
cat, mule, pig, goose, monkey, and
so on. Picture the mental torture and
degradation undergone by the self-respecting
rodent who overhears the
contemptuous exclamation, "Rats!"
Realise, if you can, the stigma attached
to the hard-working order of garden
annelids when, possibly in their very
presence, one human being addresses
another as a "worm"!</p>

<p>Then, again, take the deplorable
breaches of etiquette on the part of
visitors at the Zoo. We ourselves
have heard the most uncomplimentary
allusions made to the appearance of
the baboons and the hippopotamus, in
the hearing of those unfortunate creatures,
and quite regardless of their
<i>amour propre</i>. The callous Cockney
takes care to insult his helpless victims
only when they are behind bars and
cannot retaliate effectively. One shudders
to think of the mental humiliation
that is daily experienced by the warthog
and the mandrill. And even the
nobler animals&mdash;the lions and bears&mdash;are
not allowed to escape without
prejudicial comment, especially at feeding-time.
Not the slightest deference
is paid to the private opinions and
sentiments of these carnivores by the
vulgar crowd of sight-seers. The
parrots alone can ease their harassed
souls and have the last word with the
passer-by.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have to apologise to
our cat for having recently upbraided
him rather too freely for his nocturnal
habits and general lack of discipline,
not having considered the shock of
such language to his sensitive mind.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I can remember this Court and can tell a tale
it plays a part in, only not very quick." Thus Mr. <span class="sc">William
De Morgan</span>, introductory, on the fourth page of his latest
novel, When <i>Ghost meets Ghost</i> (<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>). Before it
ends there have been as near nine hundred pages of it as
makes no difference; and the things that the author remembers
in the course of the tale, and the not-very-quickness
with which he tells it, must be seen to be believed. The
main outline of this more than leisurely plot is concerned
with the coming together of two aged twin sisters, each of
whom has been living for years in ignorance of the other's
existence, so that they meet at last almost as ghosts.
Hence the title. But you will not need to be told that
there is ever so much more in the nine hundred pages than
this. There are the children <i>Dave and Dolly</i>, for example;
likewise <i>Uncle Mo'</i>, and any quantity of humble London
types; not to mention the group that includes <i>Lady Gwen</i>,
and <i>Adrian Torrens</i>, and a score of others, all drawn with
that verbal Pre-Raphaelitism in which the author takes
such obvious delight. For myself I must honestly confess
that I have found it a little overwhelming; but that, after
all, is a question of individual taste. I suppose there is one
comparison that is inevitable. I had meant to say never
a word about <span class="sc">Charles Dickens</span> in this notice, but, like the
head of another <span class="sc">Charles</span>, it would come; and when the
chief house in the story began to rumble and finally
collapsed in a cloud of dust&mdash;well, could anyone help being
reminded of how the same incident was handled by the
master of such terrors? In brief, this latest De Morgan
left me with a profound and increased respect for the author;
some little envy for the reader whose time and taste enable
him to enjoy it as it should be enjoyed; and, for proof-readers
and reviewers, a very pure sympathy.</p>

<hr />

<p>The <i>Duchess of Wrexe</i> (<span class="sc">Secker</span>) is, I think, the longest
as it is certainly the most substantial novel that Mr. <span class="sc">Hugh
Walpole</span> has yet given us. It is the work of one who
has already made himself a force in modern fiction, and
after this book will have more than ever to be reckoned
with. Whether the reckoning will be to all tastes is
another matter; I incline to think not. Four hundred
closely printed pages, in which hardly anything happens to
the bodies of the characters, but a great deal to their spirits&mdash;this
perhaps is toughish meat for the ordinary devourer
of fiction. But for the others this study of the passing of
an epoch, the time of the Old Society, as symbolised by the
figure of the <i>Duchess</i>, will be a delight. You might suppose
from this (if you were unfamiliar with your author) that
we had here a social comedy. Nothing in fact could be
further from Mr. <span class="sc">Walpole's</span> design. For him, as for his
characters, there is almost too haunting a sense of the
tragedy of trivial things. No one in the book is happy.
The <i>Duchess</i> herself, stern, aloof, terrible, broken but never
bent by the oncoming of the New Order; the various
members of the family whom she terrified; <i>Rachel</i>, the
granddaughter, between whom and the old woman there
exists the bond of one of those hatreds in which Mr.
<span class="sc">Walpole</span> so exults; the secretary, <i>Lizzie Rand</i>&mdash;all of
them are tremendously and miserably alive. I think the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span>
matter is that they have too much sensibility, of the modern
kind. They see too many meanings. A primrose by a
river's brim, or more probably in a flower-seller's basket, is
not for them a simple primrose, but a portent of soul-shaking
significance. To make up for this the author has
gifted them with his own exquisite sense of colour and
words, and especially a feeling for the beauty of London
that at times almost reconciles them to life. But I could
wish them merrier.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Harold Spender's</span> new novel, <i>One Man Returns</i>
(<span class="sc">Mills and Boon</span>), opens with a very powerful and dramatic
situation. Nothing in its way could be better than
the description of the lonely <i>Trevena</i> family, of their vigil
during the terrible storm, of the shipwreck and the sudden
arrival of the two strangers, father and son, who are
its only survivors. The father dies immediately without
revealing his identity, and the son, slowly nursed back to
health by the devoted care of <i>Enid Trevena</i>, resumes his
life without any consciousness of the past, having forgotten
even his own name. As
a matter of fact he is
<i>Cyril Oswald</i>, the lawful
inheritor of Oswald Hall
and great estates, which,
of course, pass into the
possession of the nearest
villain. This is <i>Major
Harley</i>, a gentleman of a
lurid past and an infamous
present, mitigated
only by the fact that he
has a beautiful and
amiable daughter,
<i>Dorothy</i>, who, having
been educated at Roedean
School, conceives herself
to be qualified to run
after beagles. In the
natural course of things
she sprains her ankle
and is beloved by <i>Rupert
Sandford</i>, the chief
beagler of the novel. She
then quarrels with her disgraceful parent, is adopted by <i>Mrs.
Sandford</i> (mother to <i>Rupert</i>), and becomes the affianced bride
of <i>Rupert</i>, though for a time she had been inclined to look
with favour on <i>Cyril</i>. This young gentleman eventually
recovers his estates by course of law and returns to Cornwall
and <i>Enid</i> just in time to cut out that young lady from
under the guns of <i>Merrifield</i>, a South African millionaire
who had complicated the situation by providing <i>Cyril</i> with
money for his law-suit. What happened to <i>Major Harley</i>
is not stated, but I presume he must have drunk off the
phial of poison which such desperate adventurers always
carry concealed about their persons.</p>

<hr />

<p>"The matrimonial career of suburban lovers," says Miss
<span class="sc">Jessie Pope</span> in a prologue to <i>The Tracy Tubbses</i> (<span class="sc">Mills
and Boon</span>), "is seldom variegated by so many curious
happenings as fell to the lot of Mr. and Mrs. <i>Tracy Tubbs</i>;"
and to this statement I can give my unqualified assent.
No sooner were the <i>T. T.'s</i> married than they were beset by
such wonderful and various misfortunes that I should like to
try and "place" them. The Lion, I think, won in a canter,
<i>Aunt Julia</i> was a bad second, and The Chafing-dish was
third, while among the "also ran" were several Policemen,
The Balloon, <i>Cross-eyed Cranstone</i> and The Motor-Bicycle.
But whether the <i>T. T.'s</i> were nearly devoured by wild
beasts or merely annoyed by aunts and chafing-dishes, they
continued to embrace each other with magnificent heartiness
whenever they had a moment to spare. In short,
Miss <span class="sc">Pope's</span> high spirits never flag; and, even if you fail
to be amused by all the incidents in the <i>T. T.'s</i> career, you
will be glad to make the acquaintance&mdash;under a new aspect,
for Miss <span class="sc">Pope's</span> talent as a maker of light verse is established&mdash;of
a writer so unaffectedly cheerful and exhilarating.</p>

<hr />

<p>"I cannot marry you or any man; <i>I am not free</i>," said
<i>Polly Adair</i> to <i>Hemingway</i>, and the italics were her own.
For my part, having been rather pointedly informed earlier
in the story that the lady was understood in Zanzibar to
be a widow, I began at this stage to suspect that there was
something lacking in the lateness of <i>Mr. Adair</i>. This was
a great pity, because <i>Polly</i> and <i>Hemingway</i> were obviously
meant for each other, as she and he and I and Mr. <span class="sc">Richard
Harding Davis</span> were unanimously agreed. But there the
fatal obstacle was, whatever it might be. "I am not free,"
she repeated, and again the italics were her very own.
After much to-do, it came
out that what she meant
was that she had a
brother who oughtn't to
be free; ought, if justice
were done, to be picking
oakum or whatever else
they pick in their leisure
hours way back in U.S.A.
And this was the whole
and the sole fatal obstacle!
<i>Hemingway</i> took it
as it came; Mr. <span class="sc">Davis</span>
seemed quite pleased
about it; but I felt that
I had been wantonly
deceived. Baffle me by
all means, said I, but do
not lie to me. Maybe I
was not in a good temper
at the time, for the three
preceding stories were
not calculated to stir the
gentlest reader's sympathies.
Possibly I am not in a good temper now, for the
three later stories (though "<i>The God of Coincidence</i>" only
just missed fire) were not distracting enough to deaden my
sense of injury. A pity, for <i>The Lost Road</i> (<span class="sc">Duckworth</span>)
has such a good cover and the name of such a good author
on the back of it.</p>
